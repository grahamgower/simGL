    Def:
        Function to simulate read counts for alleles given a tree sequence data from diploid simulated individuals (2samples = ind) 
        or genotype matrix and extra information for the haplotype samples.
    Input:
        - data       : Two inputs are possible:
                            + Tree sequence data from tskit package from which the genotype matrix is going to be extracted
                            + Genotype matrix in numpy format with shape (SNPs, samples). It is assumed that the array is sorted
                              according to a individual order such that consecutive columns (e.g., data[:, 0] and data[:, 1]) 
                              correspond to the same individual.
        - mean_depth : Two inputs are possible:
                            + float > 0 with the mean depth per sample. The mean depth for every sample haplotype 
                              is going to be sampled from a normal distribution with mean = mean_depth and std = std_depth.
                              Consider that since this script assumes that individuals are diploid, if the user intends to 
                              simulate a coverage of 30X per individual, the argument should be set to 15.
                            + numpy array with shape (samples, ) with the mean depth per haplotype sample. All values must 
                              be > 0. The order of the values is going to be associated to the list of individual's samples
                              provided by ts.individuals() (in case a tree sequence data is provided) or the order of the
                              samples in the genotype matrix (if a genotype matrix is provided in the input data).
                              If the intended coverage per site for a given individual is 30, since the coverage is 
                              given per haplotype, it should be indicated consecutively and half the individual coverage (15 
                              and 15 or 14 and 16).
        - std_depth  : float that corresponds to the standard deviation of the normal distribution from which coverages are
                       going to be sampled. This value will only be used if a float value is inputet for mean_depth. 
        - e          : float between 0 and 1 representing the error rate per base per read per site. This probability is
                       assumed to be constant.
        - seed       : integer from which the numpy rng will be drawn. 
    Output:
        - Rg         : numpy array with dimentions (SNP, individual, alleles) so that each value corresponds to the number of
                       reads with a particular allele for a SNP position and a diploid individual. The index of the 3rd dimention
                       corresponds to 1 : A and ancestral allele, 2 : C and derived allele, 3 : G, 4: T.
